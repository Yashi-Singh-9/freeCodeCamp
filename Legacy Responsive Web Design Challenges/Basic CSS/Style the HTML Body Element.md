# Style the HTML Body Element

### Description

Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a `body` element.

---

We can prove that the `body` element exists here by giving it a `background-color` of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our `style` element:

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

### Tests

1. Your `body` element should have the `background-color` of black.
2. Your CSS rule should be properly formatted with both opening and closing curly brackets.
3. Your CSS rule should end with a semicolon.

### Solution

```css
<style>
body{
  background-color: black;
}
</style>
```
