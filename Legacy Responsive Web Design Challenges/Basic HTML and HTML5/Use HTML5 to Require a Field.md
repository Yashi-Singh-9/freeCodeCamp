# Use HTML5 to Require a Field

### Description

You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute `required` within your `input` element, like this: <`input type="text" required>`

---

Make your text `input` a `required` field, so that your user can't submit the form without completing this field.

Then try to submit the form without inputting any text. See how your HTML5 form notifies you that the field is required?

### Tests

1. Your text `input` element should have the `required` attribute.
