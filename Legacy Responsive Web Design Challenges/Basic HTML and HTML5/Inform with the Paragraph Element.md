# Inform with the Paragraph Element

### Description

The `p` element is the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. `p` is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:

```html
<p>I'm a p tag!</p>
```
---

Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text Hello Paragraph.

Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example `<p></p>` and not `<P></P>`.

### Tests

1. Your code should have a valid `p` element.
2. Your `p` element should have the text `Hello Paragraph`.
3. Your `p` element should have a closing tag.

### Solution

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```
