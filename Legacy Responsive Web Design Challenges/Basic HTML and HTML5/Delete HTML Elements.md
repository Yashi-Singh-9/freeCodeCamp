# Delete HTML Elements

### Description

Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.

Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

---

Delete your `h1` element so we can simplify our view.

### Tests

1. Your `h1` element should be deleted.
2. Your `h2` element should be on the page.
3. Your `p` element should be on the page.

### Solution

```html
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
